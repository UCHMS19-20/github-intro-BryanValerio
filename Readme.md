### Introduction ###
* Github is a open-source repository.
* There are a lot of different uses and functions that it brings, which include:
  * Working with others on different files
  * Keeping an organized list of things that you have worked on 
  * The ability to merge them later up if working on separate 
  * To look back @ different 'branches' and pick one that you think is the best
  
## Future ##
* I'm looking forward to using using Git in the future beacuse the possibilities that it holds.
